# Classification-of-Weather-Data-using-scikit-learn

## Daily Weather Data Analysis

In this notebook, I will use scikit-learn to perform a decision tree based classification of weather data.

This metadata was curated from sensor data
of a weather station located here in San Diego, California
and the weather station has sensors that capture
weather related measurements such as air temperature,
air pressure, and relative humidity.
The data was collected from a period of three years.
So it has longitudinal information from September 2011
to September 2014 and this ensures also
that sufficient data for different seasons
and weather conditions are captured.
Let us now import our necessary library.
